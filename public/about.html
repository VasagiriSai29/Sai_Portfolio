<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sai Hemanth. I am a Software Engineer at DXC  Technology. Here, I work as a mainframe operator</p>

<p>I've been working here for over a year and am gaining the most knowledge as Mainframe Operations Expert. As part of my present position, I oversee monitoring all five accounts and doing health checks. I handle abends and make any necessary changes to resolve any difficulties.

<p>In addition, I am responsible for weekly maintenance IPLs, alert monitoring, system health checks, job demand management, and assuring task execution success, including error handling and resolution. Furthermore, I address ad-hoc occurrences and specific requests as they arise. I actively contribute to modifying the present plan to optimize tasks and ensure efficient task recycling. Console monitoring is an essential part of my job. I am skilled at creating tickets in HPSM (HP Service Manager) and following the escalation matrix to ensure effective issue resolution. I received the FY23 Q2 Champs Award, a testament to my outstanding contributions and dedication to excellence. I have participated in co-curricular activities, including Webinars, Hackathons, and Event management, like organizing fests and anchoring, in addition to my academic accomplishments. My leadership and practical communication skills have grown because of these experiences.
